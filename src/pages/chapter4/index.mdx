The band Snow Patrol released the song Chasing cars on 6/6/06. Let us first of all both agree that that's actually a very neat date to release a song on.

"Let's waste time,
chasing cars,
around our heads"…

..are the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th lines in the song. No one, except the artist I believe knows the actual meaning of the 3 lines. But that's okay, because that's art, open to be given any meaning.

It's also sometimes true that the meaning you find in a piece of art might not be the meaning the artist necessarily intended to be there.

Intended or not, a popular interpretation of "chasing cars" is that of a fruitless endeavor. It's about dogs chasing cars. It's about how dogs see a car approaching, zero in on it, and run after it as it swifts by. All the while not knowing what they'd do if they caught one. But I guess it's fun for the dogs regardless.

For a good part of this chapter, we will learn Mathematics and Trigonometry. Then we'll take that knowledge and draw upside-down triangles. Mathematics and Trigonometry are heavy words and sometimes intimidating too. Well, not here. As long as you know how to read English and Numbers - which I should assume in the 4th chapter of my book that you do - you're set!

What good will learning to draw Triangles on your computer screens do you? For one, it'll later deepen your understanding of the recursive process, as we'll use that knowledge to draw recursive art. Other than that, I don't know, but it'll be fun regardless.

## René Descartes and the Fly on the ceiling

First with the pronunciation. It's re-NAY day-KART with the K of KART coming from the throat. You can ignore the coming from the throat part if you're not French. Now that I am past my chance to be pompous and correct your pronunciation, we can move ahead. 

René was a 16th-century philosopher, scientist, and mathematician. "I think therefore I am", must ring a bell, it was him who said this. Descartes was one of the most skeptiest skeptics we've had walk our planet. He doubted everything, in the sense that he doubted reality, "How is the world not just a simulation? Is my body real? Can I trust my senses? Is anything real? MY GAAWW…" Until he came to a conclusion, that the one thing he cannot doubt, is the fact that he's having doubts. And doubts are essentially thoughts. And if there are thoughts, there must be a thinker, and that thinker is him. And hence, "I think, therefore I am".

As the story goes, one day while laying on his bed till late staring at the ceiling, René notices a fly.

[ART FLY ON THE CEILING]

And out of nowhere comes to him the idea of devising a system that could precisely tell the location of the said fly on the said ceiling. And just like that the current popular Math and Science of Coordinate Geometry and subsequently Calculus and everything else that relies on that was born. Because a fly decided to stick on the ceiling above René's head.

René thought if he chose a corner of the ceiling as a reference point, called origin, and drew two axes, he could tell the position of the fly with absolute precision.

[ART OF CEILING CONVERTING INTO A COORDINATE SYSTEM]

Or in simpler words, now if there's a fly on the ceiling above you, instead of pointing to the ceiling and saying "look there's the fucking fly". You can say, well, the fly is precisely located 23 cms to the right from the bottom left corner (origin) and 10cms above it. And you can attach a unique positional coordinate to the fly. x (the horizontal distance from the reference point) and y ( the vertical distance from the reference point). 

Thanks to Descartes.

This two-dimensional system of describing the position of a point is called the Cartesian coordinate system, this has of course also been extended to 3d with z-axis, but that's none of our concern here. Newton later developed 10 different coordinate systems, as we would anticipate with the fact that he finished inventing calculus at the age of 26. One of those systems is the Polar coordinate system, which was later developed further by another one of the smart ones, Jakob Bernoulli. Which is actually pronounced….oh well nevermind.

And since we're lost in history and mathematics let's not forget the agenda of all this is to draw triangles on our computer screens. We'll need to know Polar Coordinate Geometry to do that, so let's keep going.

<br/>
<br/>

## The Polar Coordinate system

<br/>

Like the Cartesian Coordinate system, the Polar coordinate system is also used to specify a location of a point, or, yes, a fly. Instead of saying it's `x` units in the horizontal direction and `y` units in the vertical direction from the reference point (or the origin), in the Polar coordinate system we say it's at a distance `r` away from the reference point and at an angle of `θ` (theta).

[ART OF LOCATION OF FLY IN THE POLAR COORDINATE SYSTEM]

Hence, instead of uniquely specifying a point's position by `(x, y)` in the Polar Coordinate system we use `(r, θ)`.

And of course, if you can't see it yet, these two Coordinate systems don't exist exclusive of each other. They are just different systems of specifying the location of a point on a 2-dimensional plane. Which is to say that the fly on the ceiling can be called out by one person to be `x` cms in the horizontal direction and `y` cms towards the top from a decided origin, and by another person to be `r` cms away at an angle of `30 degrees` from the origin. Both are correct.

Moreover, these two coordinate systems are interchangeable with the help of some *cough* *cough* don't run away, Trigonometry. We'll see how in a bit.

Now we both know it's too early and there are too few lines I have written about the Polar Coordinate system to expect you to completely understand and run home with it. For now, though, knowing that something like a "Polar Coordinate system" exists and it's used to specify the position of a point on a plane is enough. Now, before we can move any further we need to get one thing out of the way and straight into our heads, theta (`θ`).

## Theta, Degrees, Radians, and the Circle

<br/>

Let's assume that the only unit of measuring angles that you know is degrees.

"There are more, Nash?"

Yes, now don't interrupt me.

You've grown up with degrees, seen it, used it, and if I ask you to draw an angle of 60 degrees on a paper with just a pencil and no measuring tool you'd probably get it right, or close to it because you can visualize what an angle of 60 degrees looks like, and 180 degrees and 30 degrees e.t.c. But have you ever asked, where did this "degree" come from?

I bet you haven't because there are more important questions in life than to bother yourself with the origin of a measuring unit. We will, regardless, answer that today.

There's an intimate relationship between circles and angles. About 4,000 years ago the Babylonians decided to divide a circle into 360 equal parts and called one of the parts one degree. 60 of them becomes 60 degrees, 90, 90 degrees, or a right angle e.t.c.

It worked out alright, stood the test of time, and 4,000 years later in our schools we still teach that all the angles of an equilateral triangle are 60 "degrees". It's not so immediately evident but there's a problem with this unit of measurement. I might be preaching, but this unit of measurement and the way it's defined mars the elegance Mathematics should possess.

> Mathematics, rightly viewed, possesses not only truth, but supreme beauty - a beauty cold and austere, like that of sculpture, without appeal to any part of our weaker nature, without the gorgeous trappings of painting or music, yet sublimely pure, and capable of a stern perfection such as only the greatest art can show. - Bertrand Russell

If you ask, why divide the circle into 360 equal parts, why not 400? Why not 150? There's no clear answer, we can say it's because 360 is readily divisible, has 24 divisors, a year is about 360 days e.t.c but, that's not the original reason. We're deriving reasons after we already have 360 in place, if the Babylonians had decided to go with 400, we would be giving reasons why 400 is a good number of parts to divide a circle in.

Choosing a number that we feel is right is in fact, in the words of Bertrand Russell "..appeal to a part of our weaker nature". We need a new unit of measurement for angles, one that is not based on an arbitrarily chosen number.

Let's start with a circle and define something called "Arc Length". As fancy as it sounds it's … uhh…not. Here's what arc length is. Consider a portion of the circle's circumference.

[ART]

Straighten it and measure its length, whatever the measurement is the arc length of that arc.

[art]

Next, let's take a circle of radius `r`.

[art]

Then, consider an arc of arc length same as the length of the radius `r`.

[art]

Whatever angle this arc subtends at the center of the circle is our 1 [new unit], as opposed to dividing a circle in 360 parts and calling one part 1 [degree].

[art]

We need a name for this unit. Since it's based on something so innate (and not arbitrary) - the radius, let's call it "radian", or "rad" for short.

Therefore, the definition for 1 radian is: the angle subtended at the center of a circle by an arc equal in length to its radius.

This implies the angle subtended by arc length of 2 radii will be two radians.

3 radii 3 radians …. and,

(bottom here needs some rephrasing)
An arc of semicircle will be the same as the arclength of semicircle which, we know is 2πr/2 = πr. Don't we?

Since both radians and degrees are units of measurement of angles, there must be a relation between them that allows you to convert radians to degrees and vice versa. Similar to how you'd convert Fahrenheit to Celsius or Kilometers to Miles and vice versa.

In a semicircle, the angle subtended at the center is 180 degrees, and like we just saw the same measure in radians is π radians. Therefore from here, we can derive a relation

180 degrees = π radians
60 degrees = π/3 radians
30 degrees = π/6 radians
e.t.c

Measuring angles in radians is what makes calculus possible, degrees are good only to a certain point, if they were useful even beyond a certain level of Mathematics they would be used and not replaced by radians. In drawing triangles, we'll be using radians and not degrees, and that's why you had to read through this entire section. Moving on!
