The band Snow Patrol released the song Chasing cars on 6/6/06. Let us first of all both agree that that's actually a very neat date to release a song on.

"Let's waste time,
chasing cars,
around our heads"…

..are the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th lines in the song. No one, except the artist I believe knows the actual meaning of the 3 lines. But that's okay, because that's art, open to be given any meaning.

It's also sometimes true that the meaning you find in a piece of art might not be the meaning the artist necessarily intended to be there.

Intended or not, a popular interpretation of "chasing cars" is that of a fruitless endeavor. It's about dogs chasing cars. It's about how dogs see a car approaching, zero in on it, and run after it as it swifts by. All the while not knowing what they'd do if they caught one. But I guess it's fun for the dogs regardless.

For a good part of this chapter, we will learn Mathematics and Trigonometry. Then we'll take that knowledge and draw upside-down triangles. Mathematics and Trigonometry are heavy words and sometimes intimidating too. Well, not here. As long as you know how to read English and Numbers - which I should assume in the 4th chapter of my book that you do - you're set!

What good will learning to draw Triangles on your computer screens do you? For one, it'll later deepen your understanding of the recursive process, as we'll use that knowledge to draw recursive art. Other than that, I don't know, but it'll be fun regardless.

## René Descartes and the Fly on the ceiling

First with the pronunciation. It's re-NAY day-KART with the K of KART coming from the throat. You can ignore the coming from the throat part if you're not French. Now that I am past my chance to be pompous and correct your pronunciation, we can move ahead. 

René was a 16th-century philosopher, scientist, and mathematician. "I think therefore I am", must ring a bell, it was him who said this. Descartes was one of the most skeptiest skeptics we've had walk our planet. He doubted everything, in the sense that he doubted reality, "How is the world not just a simulation? Is my body real? Can I trust my senses? Is anything real? MY GAAWW…" Until he came to a conclusion, that the one thing he cannot doubt, is the fact that he's having doubts. And doubts are essentially thoughts. And if there are thoughts, there must be a thinker, and that thinker is him. And hence, "I think, therefore I am".

As the story goes, one day while laying on his bed till late staring at the ceiling, René notices a fly.

[ART FLY ON THE CEILING]

And out of nowhere comes to him the idea of devising a system that could precisely tell the location of the said fly on the said ceiling. And just like that the current popular Math and Science of Coordinate Geometry and subsequently Calculus and everything else that relies on that was born. Because a fly decided to stick on the ceiling above René's head.

René thought if he chose a corner of the ceiling as a reference point, called origin, and drew two axes, he could tell the position of the fly with absolute precision.

[ART OF CEILING CONVERTING INTO A COORDINATE SYSTEM]

Or in simpler words, now if there's a fly on the ceiling above you, instead of pointing to the ceiling and saying "look there's the fucking fly". You can say, well, the fly is precisely located 23 cms to the right from the bottom left corner (origin) and 10cms above it. And you can attach a unique positional coordinate to the fly. x (the horizontal distance from the reference point) and y ( the vertical distance from the reference point). 

Thanks to Descartes.

This two-dimensional system of describing the position of a point is called the Cartesian coordinate system, this has of course also been extended to 3d with z-axis, but that's none of our concern here. Newton later developed 10 different coordinate systems, as we would anticipate with the fact that he finished inventing calculus at the age of 26. One of those systems is the Polar coordinate system, which was later developed further by another one of the smart ones, Jakob Bernoulli. Which is actually pronounced….oh well nevermind.

And since we're lost in history and mathematics let's not forget the agenda of all this is to draw triangles on our computer screens. We'll need to know Polar Coordinate Geometry to do that, so let's keep going.
