The difference between normal solutions and recursive ones is that of foresight and trust. Generally, while coming up with a non-recursive solution, your thought process knows the exact steps and where those steps lead to, that's foresight. Whereas, in recursion, you have to, to some degree rely on trusting the process, because you can't–realistically–trace the complete execution of the program.

Whether it's `factorial`, `getFibTerm` or `isOdd`. In all of these recursive functions, it's difficult, and with a greater magnitude of parameters - close to impossible to see exactly how the function is going to unfold and reveal an answer. Even if you were, with some minor difficulties able to trace their execution, as the examples will grow complex you will find yourself losing that foresight and the ability to trace the execution, and it'll be frustrating.

That is why this chapter is important, it'll help you learn to trust. That even though you cannot trace or see how a recursive function will arrive at a solution, you can trust that it will. Given, that you have the correct recursive insight.

The problem we're going to explore in this chapter has no computational utility, it's not an algorithm that makes your online transactions smoother or makes memes load faster. It exists entirely to help develop your trust in the recursive process.

Well, now that I have warmed you up with four bland paragraphs. Let's jump right into the problem!
