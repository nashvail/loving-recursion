Introducing the next chapter at the very beginning of the chapter that you're writing has to be the worst way to write an introduction to a chapter. But I just CAN'T WAIT to tell you that in the coming chapter we will learn how to draw using Math and JavaScript.

Since drawing with Math is going to be so exciting and consuming, you could lose touch with everything we have learned so far. Therefore, as the last polish to the tools we have collected, we'll solve one more example before proceeding to Math and drawing or, "Graphical Recursion".

The problem that we're going to write a recursive solution for in this chapter is a simple one. The problem of reversing a word. Since when did reversing words become a problem? I don't know, it's not a pressing global problem just a computer science/mathematics problem… why am I even explaining this?

Like we've been doing in the book so far, we'll use JavaScript to write the solution to this problem. If you're using any other programming language, the string manipulation methods that you'll see me using might not be available in that particular language. So it's up to you to either use a library or best, figure everything out yourself.

And now, to the problem.

So we've got a word, say LAPTOP, that we want to reverse. A reversed LAPTOP becomes?...

POTPAL 

Do you see what reversing a word is?

The non-recursive way of reversing a word is to begin by picking the extreme letters, switching their positions, and then, incrementally moving in from both sides and switching positions of the remaining letters one by one.

The recursive solution is along the same lines, but it's going to be a lot more elegant. Before reading further, if you could attempt the solution yourself, that would make papa Nash super happy.

As you set off on this new adventure of yours, thinking and grappling, I would like to talk to you about something, if I have your permission.

Sometimes you see, I dream of living in a world where it's legal to use a rule, a procedure, or a formula only if you know how/why that formula works. I also dream about a world where cafe latte pours out of sink taps as soon as you walk into the kitchen, an unending supply of sogginess murderer soup.

Make what you can of that and let's keep going.

Take the polygon below for example, what's the sum of its interior angles (shown in blue and called so because they are *inside* the polygon)?

![Interior angles](2.png)

"That's a very random question!", I know, but play along.

Here's the formula to calculate the sum of interior angles of a polygon, let's pretend like we have common sense, and instead of calling it the "sum of interior angles of a polygon" over and over again, call it something simple, like capital S.

So, according to the formula:

$$
\textnormal{S} = 180^\circ \times (\textnormal{No. of sides} - 2)
$$

Count the number of sides, plug it into the formula, and off you go with the correct answer.

Since the polygon above has 8 sides, we can plug in 8 into the formula

$$
\textnormal{S} = 180^\circ \times (8 - 2) \\
\Rightarrow 180^\circ \times 6 \\
\Rightarrow 1080^\circ
$$

Cool, right?

Fast and easy, huh?

It has been observed - as David Epstein in his book Range points out - that in educationally high-performing countries, students are engaged more in "making connections" questions than in "using procedures" questions. To look at a polygon, count its sides, plug in the number and run off with the correct answer is a "using procedure" pattern. But, if I was to take the formula for calculating the sum of interior angles away from you and leave you out in the wild to cobble, struggle and figure an answer for yourself, that would be a "making connections" pattern.

> When students bring home problems that force them to make connections, Richland told me, "parents are like, 'let me show you a easier way'" . [The parents] are not good at seeing bewildered kids. But, with learning that is both durable and flexible fast and easy is precisely the problem. - From [Range (David Epstein)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range)

A polygon has as many interior angles as its number of sides. A pentagon has 5 sides and 5 interior angles, an octagon has 8 sides and 8 interior angles and a triagon has 3 of both. (Sign the petition to rename triangle to triagon at your neighbourhood Mathematician's house today!)

![A polygon has as many internal angles as its number of sides](3.png)

The other type of angles these polygons have are called exterior angles. They are the angles between one side extended in length and the outside of the adjacent side.

These are the three exterior angles in a triangle.

The cool thing about the exterior angles is that if you were to club them together they'd form a whole 3 hundred and 60 degrees. (360)

![Exterior angles of a polygon always sum to 360 degrees](5.png)

In any other polygon, square for example. The exteriors also sum up to 360 degrees, and in a pentagon too, and also in a hexagon and any other -gon. Because in any polygon it is possible to arrange the sides to look as if they are originating from one point. And when you follow along summing up the angles you realise that they form a circle and what's a full circle angle? Correct! 360 degrees.

From here we deduce that the sum of exterior angles of any polygon is always equal to 360 degrees.

Hang on to this deduction, and if you please call it -(Deduction 1). Because what is Math if not an excuse to sound smart.
