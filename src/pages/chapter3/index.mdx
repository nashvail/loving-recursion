Introducing the next chapter at the very beginning of the chapter that you're writing has to be the worst way to write an introduction to a chapter. But I just CAN'T WAIT to tell you that in the coming chapter we will learn how to draw using Math and JavaScript.

Since drawing with Math is going to be so exciting and consuming, you could lose touch with everything we have learned so far. Therefore, as the last polish to the tools we have collected, we'll solve one more example before proceeding to Math and drawing or, "Graphical Recursion".

The problem that we're going to write a recursive solution for in this chapter is a simple one. The problem of reversing a word. Since when did reversing words become a problem? I don't know, it's not a pressing global problem just a computer science/mathematics problem… why am I even explaining this?

Like we've been doing in the book so far, we'll use JavaScript to write the solution to this problem. If you're using any other programming language, the string manipulation methods that you'll see me using might not be available in that particular language. So it's up to you to either use a library or best, figure everything out yourself.

And now, to the problem.

So we've got a word, say LAPTOP, that we want to reverse. A reversed LAPTOP becomes?...

POTPAL 

Do you see what reversing a word is?

The non-recursive way of reversing a word is to begin by picking the extreme letters, switching their positions, and then incrementally moving in from both sides and switching positions of the remaining letters one by one.

The recursive solution is along the same lines, but it's going to be a lot more elegant. Before reading further, if you could attempt the solution yourself, that would make papa Nash super happy.

As you set off on this new adventure of yours, thinking and grappling, I would like to talk to you about something, if I have your permission.

Sometimes you see, I dream of living in a world where it's legal to use a rule, a procedure, or a formula only if you know how/why that formula works. I also dream about a world where cafè latte pours out of sink taps as soon as you walk into the kitchen.

Take the polygon below for example, what's the sum of its interior angles (shown in blue and called so because they are *inside* the polygon)?

![Interior angles](2.png)

"That's a very random question!", I know, but play along.

Here's the formula to calculate the sum of interior angles of a polygon. But before that, some nomenclature because I don't want to be writing "Sum of interior angles of a polygon" or, "Number of sides in a polygon" over and over again, so we'll use:
1. `S-I` for Sum of interior angles, and
2. `N` for Number of sides in a polygon

Coming back to the formula, here's how it goes:

$$
\textnormal{S-I} = 180^\circ \times (\textnormal{N} - 2)
$$

Count the number of sides, plug it into the formula, and off you go with the correct answer.

Since the polygon shown above has 8 sides, we can plug in 8 into the formula to get the sum of its interior angles.

$$
\textnormal{S-I} = 180^\circ \times (8 - 2) \\
\Rightarrow 180^\circ \times 6 \\
\Rightarrow 1080^\circ
$$

Cool, right?

Fast and easy, huh?

It has been observed - as David Epstein in his book Range points out - that in educationally high-performing countries, students are engaged more in "making connections" questions than in "using procedures" questions. To look at a polygon, count its sides, plug in the number and run off with the correct answer is a "using procedure" pattern. But, if I was to take the formula for calculating the sum of interior angles away from you and leave you out in the wild to cobble, struggle and figure an answer for yourself, that would be a "making connections" pattern.

> When students bring home problems that force them to make connections, Richland told me, "parents are like, 'let me show you a easier way'" . [The parents] are not good at seeing bewildered kids. But, with learning that is both durable and flexible fast and easy is precisely the problem. - From [Range (David Epstein)](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41795733-range)

A polygon has as many interior angles as its number of sides. A pentagon has 5 sides and 5 interior angles, an octagon has 8 sides and 8 interior angles and a triagon has 3 of both. (Sign the petition to rename triangle to triagon at your neighbourhood Mathematician's house today!)

![A polygon has as many internal angles as its number of sides](3.png)

The other type of angles polygons have are called exterior angles. They are the angles between one side extended in length and the outside of the adjacent side.

These are the three exterior angles in a triangle.

![Exterior angles of a Triangle](4.png)

The cool thing about the exterior angles is that if you were to club them together they'd form a whole 3 hundred and 60 degrees.

![Exterior angles of a polygon always sum to 360 degrees](5.png)

In any other polygon, square for example. The exteriors also sum up to 360 degrees, and in a pentagon too, and also in a hexagon and any other -gon. Because in any polygon it is possible to arrange the sides to look as if they are originating from one point. And when you follow along summing up the angles you realise that they form a circle and what's a full circle angle? Correct! 360 degrees.

![Exterior angles in any polygon add up to 360 degrees](mid-1.png)

From here we deduce that the sum of exterior angles of any polygon is always equal to 360 degrees.

Hang on to this deduction, and if you please call it -(Deduction 1). Because what is Math if not an excuse to sound smart.

Now if we were to take a triangle (or any polygon). We can see a unique relation between the interior (blue) and exterior (white) angle pairs.

![Interior and Exterior angles shown together, like never before.](6.png)

The first observation is that, a given pair of exterior and interior angles lie on a straight line. Which means the sum of each of  these pairs is equal to 180 degrees.

![Each exterior + interior angle pairs add up to 180 degrees](7.png)

Another, quite rudimentary observation is that the number of pairs of exterior + interior angles in a polygon is equal to the number of sides it has.

In a triangle we have three pairs of angles, if we had a pentagon with PENT sides, we'd have 5 pairs of angles each pair adding up to 180 degrees. 

![Number of Interior Exterior angle pairs = Number of sides in a polygon](8.png)

From these two observations, and make sure you get it, we can say,

$$
\textnormal{Sum of all interior angles} + \textnormal{Sum of all exterior angles} =
$$

$$
\textnormal{Number of I-E angle pairs} \times 180^\circ
$$

Now one thing we already made abundantly clear is that the Sum of exterior angles is 360 degrees.

And the thing about the number 360 is, 

$$
360 = 180 \times 2
$$

THEREFORE,

$$
\textnormal{Sum of all interior angles} + (2 \times 180^\circ) =
$$

$$
\textnormal{Number of I-E angle pairs} \times 180^\circ
$$

Now number of Interior Exterior angle pairs is same as the number of sides in a polygon.

So, for any polygon (holup we're getting there)

$$
\textnormal{Sum of all interior angles} + (2 \times 180^\circ) =
$$

$$
\textnormal{Number of sides in a polygon} \times 180^\circ
$$


Substituting that (we're using big mathy words now) into the formula above, we arrive at a simple procedure.

Sum of interior angles of a polygon + (2 * 180) = (number of sides * 180)
=> Sum of interior angles of a polygon = (number of sides * 180) - (2 * 180)

Or, after taking 180 as common,

Sum of interior angles of a polygon = 180 * (number of sides in that polygon - 2).

And now you know where the formula in which you can simply plug in the number of sides and be handed the answer came from. When you understand why a formula works, it sticks better and for longer.

So much to say that if you're writing recursive solutions, or reading recursive solutions, what's important is not just identifying the rules. Rules are handy, they're quick, they're great, they're like little beautiful mathematical poems but, the real reward is in understanding why the rules work. Understanding forces you to make connections between concepts. Connections you would have not discovered if you simply followed a procedure.

As you move forward in the book, I hope you keep this in mind and eventually also dream about a world where it's illegal to use a rule without knowing how it actually works.

And if it's difficult to trust my word on that, you can trust Socrates who said, "…to fully understand, and engage with ideas, we need to understand where they come from…"

Well, well, well guess who forgot that we are reading a book about recursion?
Hoping that you took a stab at writing a recursive solution for reversing a word, here's the actual solution.
Let's start with the "Give me this, and I'll handle the rest" rule and how it fits in this scenario.

Imagine if someone was to reverse the insides of the word for us. (Give me this)

[ART]

All that we'd have to do is switch the position of the letters at the extremes. (I'll handle the rest)
